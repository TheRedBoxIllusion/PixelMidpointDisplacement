Noise iterations: The number of octaves of perlin noise used for the caves. Each octave is smaller and contains finer and finer details																					(int)
8
Octave weights: The weights of each octave when combining them all together. In order from largest scale to smallest scale. So if you want to increase fine detail, increase the later numbers and vice versa			(doubles)

Frequency: The initial scale of the noise. A smaller frequency produces a finer detailed noise map. This is very impactful when combined with the initial pixels per block of the world context							(double)
0.0025
Vector count: The number of possible vectors for the perlin noise. The vectors are then calculated by dividing a sphere into this number of segments. This impacts the angles of the caves. 							(int)
6
Angle Offset: The angle that all the vectors are offset. To see a good demonstration of what the angle does, set the vector count to 2 and then screw with the angle													(double)
